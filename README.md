<h1>VPN's: What They Are and What they Do</h1>
</p>

<p>VPN's are often metioned in relation to privacy and internet safety. </p>

<h2>What are VPN's?</h2>
<p>A VPN is a service that allows you to "mask" your IP as being somewhere else. This can allow you to access content that might be region locked or to add a layer of protection to your computer. A more technical definition of a VPN is a secure connection between 2 computers that encrypts and encapsulates data sent between them. This can be thought of as a secure tunnel between you and the computer you are cconnecting to. This can allow you to access region-locked content as previously stated, or access private content like a database for a company you work for.</p>

<h2>Installing and Using a VPN</h2>

<h3>Necessary Components</h3>
<p>The only necessary compoments needed to use a VPN are a computer and a VPN service provider of some kind. In this example ProtonVPN will be used.</p>

As previously stated, you could access content that is exclusive to the available countries. Most other features are unavailable with a free account. This will all add a bit more security to your browsing and might improve your browsing experience as well.
